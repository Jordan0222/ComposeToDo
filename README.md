# ComposeToDo
This project is written using the MVVM architecture. First, use Retrofit to capture the JSONPlaceHolder's data, and the store it in the phone's Database. After the storage is over, you can get the data from the Database through the Repository Layer, and then send the data to UI Layer through the ViewModel Layler. Besides, I also used Dagger-Hilt to do dependecy injection in my project. Finally, my UI is programed by Jetpack Compose.
